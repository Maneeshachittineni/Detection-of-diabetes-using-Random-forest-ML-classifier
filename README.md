# Detection-of-diabetes-using-Random-forest-ML-classifier
I trained my model using a Random Forest classifier. Random Forest is an algorithm for collective learning that builds a large number of decision trees during training and outputs the class that represents the mean of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. To determine the ideal hyperparameters for Random Forest classifier, I cross-validated a grid search. I specifically searched over the n_estimators and max_depth parameters, which regulate the number of decision trees in the forest and the depth of each tree, respectively.
Performance
I used measures like accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity to assess the effectiveness of my classifier. Although specificity and sensitivity assess how well the model performs on the positive and negative classes, respectively, accuracy assesses the model's overall soundness.
Random Forest classifier achieves accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity values of 75.32%, 70.59%, and 78.26% respectively. These performance measures show that the classifier is reasonably good at differentiating between patients with and without diabetes.
